# Notes to keep track of what I am doing

Theorem type environments will be called
`menv` in code;
i.e., definitions signalled by `mdef`,
theorems signified by `mthm`,
lemmas signified by `mlemma`.
The `m` stands for margin, I like to think.
The "flags" for these things (in the document) will be in the left margin.
